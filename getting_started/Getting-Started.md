## Synchronizing the Blockchain

Running `ERA` will connect to the network and begin downloading and verifying the ERA blockchain.  
Because the blockchain is constantly growing, the file size is always increasing, and *ERA* must verify each block (CPU intensive) it may take some time for the blockchain to sync.
