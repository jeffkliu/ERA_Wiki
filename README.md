# ERA_Wiki
Documentation for all things ERA.

## About
This repository is the official home for all ERA documentation. Because of the distributed, open, community-driven nature of our development teams, we believe the easiest approach to managing our documentation is to organize all of it in this central repository.

### Contributing
Changes, edits, and other contributions to ERA's documentation can be submitted as a Github Pull Request to this repository, or as a Github Issue on this repo's Issues page.
