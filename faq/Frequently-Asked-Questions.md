When your wallet is staking, it is checking transactions to make sure everyone who sends coins actually owned those coins and had the right to transfer them. If your wallet completes a stake attempt you will be rewarded 10 ERA as compensation for securing the network. *Note:* a small 2% fee is taken from every stake reward and sent to the ERA comunity fund where the team uses those coins to get added to new exchanges and support other projects.
